# DEAfrica Landsat Scenes Sync
Dags to identify USGS Collection 2 Landsat scenes either in bulk or per-day, push them onto a queue, and then
to copy the data to Cape Town and upgrade the STAC metadata and create a notification.

## Development

### DAGs
- landsat-scenes-bulk
  * This Dag will start a Python process which will download per-satellite tar.gz files from USGS
    file server, send the STAC documents in bulk to our SQS queue in Africa.

- landsat-scenes-daily
  * This Dag will start a Python process which will access the USGS API, accordingly to informed dates, and
    send the STAC documents to our SQS queue in Africa.

- landsat-scenes-process
  * This Dag will be started by the scheduler to pull messages from the SQS queue, validate the message, process
    the message adding missing items, changing links to point to our S3 bucket and transforming from stac 0.7 to 1.0.
    After that it sends the STAC document to an SNS topic.

- landsat-scenes-indexing
  * This Dag will be started by the scheduler to pull the messages from a second SQS queue, which is
    filled automatically by the SNS, and will indexed into the Datacube.

## Airflow Requirements

Install pip modules

```bash
    pip install --user --upgrade pip && pip install --user stactools[all] pystac rasterio
```

### Logic and utils
Under the folder utils, there are the python logic and additional files.

- scenes_sync
    * Logic to download bulk files from USGS file server or access the USGS API and send the valid stacs to Africa's queue

- scenes_sync_process
    * Logic to pull messages from the SQS queue, validate the message, process one by one adding missing items,
      changing links to point to our S3 bucket and transforming from stac 0.7 to 1.0.
      After that sending to an SNS topic.

- url_request_utils
    * Additional Python logic to treat requests and AWS connections.
